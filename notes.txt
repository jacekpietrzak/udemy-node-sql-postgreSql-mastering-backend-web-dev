# Authentication for server change
# in Postgres app -> server settings -> HBA(Host Based Authentication) -> show -> drag the file to terminal and type "code" at the beginning to open in VSCode -> go to the bottom where is METHOD column. It is an authentication method.
If we want password authentication we need to change "trust" to "md5" and save.
Restart Server in the app -> stop -> start

#If we run again our script it will ask for password
